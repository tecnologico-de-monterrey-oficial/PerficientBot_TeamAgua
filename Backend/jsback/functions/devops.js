        2.- Create a work item.
            
        Remember, there are only these 2 options, there are no others available. Just answer with the number of the option, without the period.
        Answer format: "[number]"
        Example: "2"
        
        In such case that none of the options are related to the sentence, write "I am sorry, can you rephrase your query?".`,
